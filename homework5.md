# HW05 - A Wordle Refactor

In this homework, you'll be refactoring a poorly written, yet
compiling and functional [wordle game][wordle-game] in [C][intro-c] into
a genuinely better, more testable program. Leveraging what you did and learned
from in [homework 4][hw04], we expect you to now:

* break-up the given [`wordle.c`][wordle.c] program into separate, logical functions.
  * include *REQUIRES*/*ENSURES* contracts.
  * the code should still compile and work as advertised!
* rename variables into meaningful, readable names.
* write comments explaining the logic that's happening in the code.
* test each function and any game logic in [`test_wordle.c`][test_wordle.c].

**Note**: We don't expect you to work on this assignment over the official
holiday break. The given deadline and expectations for this assignment already
have considered the holiday.

### Reminder: What are the basic tenets of wordle?

* **Five-Letter Word**: The target word is always five letters long.
* **Limited Attempts**: Players have a set number of attempts (usually six) to guess the correct word.
* **Feedback on Guesses**: After each guess, the player receives feedback on each letter:
  - The correct letter is in the correct position.
  - The correct letter is in the wrong position.
  - Incorrect letter.
* **Word List**: The game typically uses a predetermined word list, and players
  try to guess the target word based on their knowledge and the feedback provided.
* **No Time Limit**: There's no time pressure in the game; players can take their
  time to strategize and make educated guesses.
* **Logical Deduction**: Success in Wordle involves logical deduction based on
  feedback from previous guesses, helping players refine their subsequent attempts.

## Learning goals
- Learn how to decompose software by breaking it down into logical parts,
  making it easier to understand, read, and maintain.
- Gain experience refactoring code (this is a real skill!).
- Use software design and testing to improve an implementation.

## Tasks
You will be asked to perform the following series of tasks:

1. *Create your homework-5 repository*, with the [GitHub classroom invite][invite]
   and clone that repository locally.

   Copy over anything useful from your homework-4 repository.

2. *Refactor* the code in [`wordle.c`][wordle.c], include contracts, and implement
   tests.

   Currently [`wordle.c`][wordle.c] is a mess! It compiles; the game works on
   the command line. But, it's not easy to follow and will become a chore to
   maintain going forward.

   For this assignment, we expect you to break up [`wordle.c`][wordle.c] into
   logical units/functions, akin **to some** of those you came up with in
   [homework 4][hw04]. We assess that there are about 3-4 functions that can
   extracted from this large, single function.

   You'll add contracts to these *new* functions (you can stress test them in
   [`test_wordle.c`][test_wordle.c]). And, you'll write tests for these
   functions and around the general logic of the game,
   *without adding additional bugs*.

   - Getting started:

     Everyone should be able to compile and run C code. For compilation,
     just check to make sure you have `gcc` installed (which should be available
     by default):

     ```sh
     gcc -v
     ```

     The [README.txt][readme.txt] has instructions on how to compile, run, and
     test the given Wordle code. The designated test file, [`test_wordle.c`][test_wordle.c]
     will run the game given no modifications:

     ```c
     int main() {
       // Test 1
       test_me(0);

       // NOTE: Comment this out when you're ready to test your game!
       wordle_game();

       // If the test passes, print a success message
       printf("Test passed!\n");

       return 0;
     }
     ```

     Comment out `wordle_game()` when you're ready to actually test your
     refactored implementation.

     Additionally, `test_wordle.c` contains a small `test_me(0)` example
     (shown above), which can be run to demonstrate the use of
     *REQUIRES*/*ENSURES* contracts in C:

     ```c
     int test_me(int x) {
       REQUIRES(x > INT_MIN);
       int res = x < 0 ? -x : x;
       ENSURES(res >= 0);
       return res;
     }
     ```

     **Note**: The word list for the game and contract assertions are already
     included for you.

3. *Re-diagram the implementation*.

   We want you to revisit your diagram from [homework 4][hw04] and modify it
   to match the structure of your refactor.

   You can commit an image, pdf, etc to your repository for review.

4. *Reflect*.

   Update the given *reflection.txt* file, briefly discussing how
   closely your pseudocode (including pseudo-contracts and pseudo-tests)
   did or didn't line up with your refactor of the given code. Did your setup
   have more or less functionality than the game given? Also, comment on how
   your diagram changed from the previous exercise.

5. *Open a Pull Request (PR)* and **do not merge it**.

    For this assignment, you should check out your branch off of the main branch,
    and push up this branch consisting of commit(s). Once this is all ready,
    [please open a Pull Request][gh-pr] to the main branch and leave it there!

6. **Challenge**: *Add difficulty to the Wordle game* and test it's
   functionality.

   Add the ability to choose the difficulty of your game on input:

   * **1** is easy
   * **2** is hard(er)

   If the setting is easy, that's the game as it works already. If the
   difficulty is set to **2**, then, during a guess, you should not be
   able to move forward (i.e. get another guess) unless you get at least
   one matching letter (either in the word or by position).

   This is worth *20* additional points.


We expect that youâ€™ll be using the [C/C++][c-vscode] Visual Studio Code
extension to help refactor your C programs. Being that this is written
in C, feel free to use another extension or editor that best suits you.

## Deadlines and Deliverables
**Due Date**: Tuesday, November 28, 2023 at 11:59 pm.

**Deliverable**: For this assignment, you have one deliverable.
1) You will either upload your GitHub repository URL to Canvas under
[assignment 5][canvas-5] (embedded via [Gradescope][gradescope] as a PDF, with
just your andrewID and link it) or DM staff over [Slack][slack].

You may use up to two (2) late days out of your total of four. To use a late
day, simply message us on [Slack][slack] to let us know that you will be using a
